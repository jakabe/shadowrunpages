>Imperial Japan boasts the greatest concentration of
megacorporate headquarters in the world. Mitsuhama,
Renraku, and Shiawase all make their home here, and
a new spirit of cooperation between the three of them
threatens to make life difficult for the other megas of
the world. Citizens of Japan take great pride in their Imperial
government and their homegrown megacorps.
They are less happy about the non-human metatypes
in their midst, though the general populace has grown
more accepting in recent years.

    >Wuxing is based in the independent city of Hong
    Kong. Hong Kong is a very business-friendly sprawl, in
    pretty much the same way the Old West town of Tombstone
    was a very gunfighter-friendly town. It’s great to
    be at the top or on the way up, but if you lose a competition
    in that sprawl, you lose hard. All of which makes
    Hong Kong very friendly to our brand of business; the
    megacorporations make or take any advantage they can
to ensure they don’t come out the losers.

   >While it’s been divided into several nations, Russia
   has managed to hold on to a winding stretch of land
   connecting its western section to the eastern coast on
   the Sea of Japan. The city of Vladivostok hosts the headquarters
   of Evo, making it one of the world’s leading
   technological centers.
