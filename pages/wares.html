>damn machines...

<p>
>Ever since the days of John Henry, we’ve been fighting
the battle against machines, trying to prove that humanity
had the upper hand on cold iron and circuitry.
It took us until earlier this century to figure out that we
shouldn’t be trying to beat the machines; we should be
joining them. Of course it all began as prosthetics—artificial
legs and hands that moved like the originals, cybernetic
eyes and ears that let people born blind or deaf
see and hear. But pretty soon people figured out what
began as medical marvels could be adapted to improve
anyone’s senses and abilities, and it wasn’t a big jump
from there to implanted phones and computers.
</p>

<p>
>These days, every bit of who you are can be improved
with the right piece of gear (unless you’re a mage or adept—
we’ll talk about that in a second). Think you’ve got
quick reflexes? You can be quicker. An artificial neural
network’ll make you faster than a nervous jackrabbit.
Think you’re strong? Switch out the muscles you were
born with for a set that’s been custom grown for brawn
and efficiency and you’ll take strong to a whole new level.
Think you’re charming? Implant a few sets of specialized
pheromone dispensers and people will swoon when you
walk by and nod enthusiastically when you talk.
</p>

<p>
>And that’s just for starters. You can put actual plates
of armor on your skin, or lace your bones with metal so that your fists and legs deliver crushing blows. You can
make your senses sharper, your brain faster, and you can
implant knowledge that you never learned in school.
You can replace entire pieces of your body with artificial
replicas full of extra strength, nimble agility, secret
compartments, and hidden weapons that provide very
unpleasant surprises at just the right time.
</p>


<p>
>But it’s not free. And we’re not just talking money;
there’s a higher price to pay. All this stuff is useful and
great, but it’s artificial. It’s not metahuman, and your
body knows it. Each time you get one of these augmentations,
you give up a piece of yourself. You lose something
inside of you, the essence of metahumanity. We
don’t quite understand what this “it” is, but we know this
much—the more artificial you make yourself, the farther
you get from actual life. If you get too far, whatever animated
you is going to disappear, until all the gear you
bought just collapses and becomes indistinguishable
from any other pile of silicon, steel, and chrome. So go
ahead and get yourself augmented up. Get those synaptic
boosters, those muscle replacements, and while
you’re at it put a sparkling datajack in your head and
some boss, day-glo nanotattoos on your face. Just understand
that each time you do this, another piece of
your metahumanity goes sliding away.
</p>

<p>
>But wait! There’s more! If you are Awakened, if you
have any sort of magical mojo, you lose more than your
essence. Your magic theorists, they’ll tell you that mana
is tied to life (which is why inanimate objects don’t have
an astral aura and there’s no magic in deep space, but
that’s another subject). You take away some of the life of
an Awakened person, you take away some of their power.
That’s why the spellslingers and adepts among us are
cautious about how many augmentations they get. But
they got their spells and their abilities, which means they
got plenty of ways to keep up even if they aren’t wired
to the gills.
</p>

<p>
>In the end, all this augmentations stuff comes down
to a single question: How much of your metahumanity
are you willing to trade for power? And that, chummer,
is a question that covers way more than how many augmentations
you get.
