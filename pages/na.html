>North America
<p>
>The formerly mighty United States and its northern
neighbor Canada were hit by powerful Native American
secession movements in the early part of the
twenty-first century that broke apart both nations and
changed the face of the continent. Perhaps the most
direct heir to the old United States is the United Canadian
and American States (UCAS), which is com-posed of much of the northeastern United States and
southeastern Canada. The nation’s capital is the old
U.S. base of DeeCee, and their ideals and government
constructs have deliberate similarities to the nation’s
predecessor. The UCAS is not as powerful as the former
United States, but it’s got enough economic clout
and military prowess to be taken seriously. Two of the
Big Ten are based in the UCAS—Ares in Detroit, and
NeoNET in Boston.
</p>

<p>
    >The UCAS is also home to the shadowrunning capital
    of the world, Seattle—and yeah, I know it’s not in
    the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada. It’s a
    lump of sprawl that got carved out of the surrounding
    Native American Nation and given to the UCAS. Seattle’s
    unique situation makes it an epicenter of trade
    and intrigue. Each of the Big Ten has a presence in the
    city (some more than others—NeoNET is all over the
    place, for example, while Renraku’s presence is a pale
    shadow of what it used to be). You can also find the
    Mafia, the Yakuza, and a whole host of other organized
    crime outfits and street gangs. The wealthy areas of the
    sprawl shimmer with polished marble and gleaming
    gold, while the poorest areas present kilometer after kilometer
    of polluted land, broken buildings, and creeping
    terrors. It’s a city of extremes, but it’s the extremes
    of light and dark that make the shadows so extensive
    and deep.   
</p>

<p>
  >The UCAS’ cousin to its south is the Confederation
  of American States (CAS). Far from being the industrial
  weakling it was in the days of the American Civil War,
  the CAS boasts a vibrant and diverse range of economic
  activity. Even if they don’t have a homegrown AAA corp
  to call their own. More importantly to shadowrunners,
  the CAS is home to the largest independent security
  corporation in the world, Lone Star. If you’re a shadowrunner,
  you’ve run into the officers of the Star before.
  If you’re a good shadowrunner, you managed to survive
  the encounter alive, mostly intact, and out of prison.

<p>
   >Most of the rest of North America is divided between
   the Native American Nations, geopolitical entities
   created when the indigenous people decided to rise
   up and retake their lands. The Pueblo Corporate Council
   has the southwest (including Los Angeles, the home
   of Horizon), the Sioux Nation reigns over much of the
   central plains, the Salish-Shidhe Council governs the
   Pacific Northwest—surrounding Seattle—while the Tsimshian
   Protectorate and Algonkian-Manitou Council
   reside in the north. Also in North America are the uncertain
   California Free State, the recovering corporate
   haven of Québec, and the elven nation of Tír Tairngire.

</p>

<p>
    >Then there’s the treaty city of Denver; a charming
    sprawl divided among five nations and ruled over by a
    dragon. The story of how that came to be will have to
    wait for another time. Suffice it to say there’s enough intrigue
    in Denver to keep a very large number of shadowrunners
    quite busy.
