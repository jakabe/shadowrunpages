    >Some of us choose the shadows, and some of us have the
    shadows thrust upon them. One of the dividing lines between
    the world of shadows and the world of light is a SIN—a
    System Identification Number—the identification you need to
    be accepted in security systems and government databases
    and pretty much any computer anywhere that authenticates
    people’s identities. If you have one, you’re a SINner, one of the
    good, normal people of the world. If you don’t have one, you’re an
    outsider. You’re pushed into the shadows of the world by default.
    </p>
    <p>So who is born without a SIN—who are the SINless
    people of the world? Well, if your parents didn’t have one, you
    probably don’t. So children of criminals, along with kids of a
    high percentage of orks or trolls (who often get denied SINs as
    a matter of course), often start off in the dark. Then there are
    criminals—the professional kind, the amateur ones, and the
    accidental ones. Whatever they did, however they got caught,
    they ended up with a criminal SIN, which is about as useful as a
    fingerless cyberhand. Most of the time, rather than staying with
    the norms and being treated like a radioactive leper, folks with a
    criminal SIN drop out of society, either running in the shadows or
    opting for the full-on criminal lifestyle (the mobs and street gangs
    of the Sixth World are always hiring).
