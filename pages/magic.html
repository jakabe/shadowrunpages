>something new...
<p>
    >There’s one date
    everyone needs to know: December 24, 2011. That’s the
    day the Sixth World started. According to the academicky
    types who like to sort things into boxes and put the
    boxes in order, this planet of ours has seen six ages, by
    which they mean six different levels of magic. The previous
    age, the Fifth World, was an ebb in magic. Magic
    was shady, disreputable, a bit slatternly, hiding out in
    dark corners and back alleys, very rarely coming out in
    the light of day. Then, on December 24, the great dragon
    Ryumyo flew out of Mount Fuji and darted alongside
    a bullet train full of very surprised commuters, pretty
    much putting the world on notice that the ebb was over.
    That was just the beginning; magic coming back meant
    big changes for the world.
</p>

<p> 
    >In fact, some of the changes had kicked in months before,
    just nobody understood that’s what was happening.
    They called it Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE)—a
    scientificky-sounding name for children being born who
    looked like the elves or dwarfs of legends and folktales.
    Only they didn’t just look the parts; the new dwarf children
    grew to be unnaturally strong and could see in near
    darkness, while the elf children had preternaturally quick
    reflexes and moved like dancers. For ten years these kids
    were freaks. Then, in 2021, they became average. That’s
    when Goblinization struck. And it was not pretty. Where
    UGE had created interesting-looking newborns, Goblinization
    struck people of all ages. The most noticeable
    symptom was blinding, mind-numbing agony that came
    in waves. This lasted twelve to seventy-two hours while
    the victims changed shape, grew tusks and/or sprouted
    horns, and maybe quadrupled their body mass. Which is
    how the orks and trolls came back. Not that they’d been
    gone—elves and dwarfs and orks and trolls had always
    been here, but in the low magic ebb of the Fifth World,
    they’d looked just like ordinary humans.
</p>
<p> 
    >In the wake of these changes, it became clear “humanity”
    was too narrow a term to cover all the types
    of people roaming the Earth, so now we call ourselves
    metahumanity. Turns out the different races don’t like each other any more now than they did in all those
    legends and fairytales. But we’re all stuck on the same
    rock spinning through space, so we deal with it.
</p>

<p>
    >It didn’t take too long for people to start trying to get
    a handle on how to use all the new magic floating around
    for themselves. Turned out some people had a knack for
    it. While the rest of us were wondering what they were
    looking at with glazed eyes and weird expressions, they
    were figuring out how to channel and shape streams of
    mana—a sort of magic energy that seems to be just about
    everywhere. Turns out, if you can suss how it’s done, you
    can use mana to set the air on fire, make people do things
    they’d never do, or things that are truly esoteric and/or insane.
    And mana wasn’t just for the spells and stuff we think
    of as magic. It gave some people the strength to punch
    through walls. Others can shame a cobra with their reflexes,
    there are some who can outrun a cheetah, and that’s
    just scratching the surface. And you know all those magic
    goodies from legends and fairytales and myths? We got
    ‘em all. Enchanted swords, magic rings, wands, amulets,
    mojo bags, every potion you can think of all exist. Not that
    they always work the way they did in the stories. Don’t
    think you can just grab the sword of a legendary warrior
    and expect to slice and dice like she did, for example. But
    the point is, magic is out there, and people are using it. The
    Atlantean Foundation, the Draco Foundation, Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology and Thaumaturgy—they’re
    regularly researching how to do the impossible with a twist
    of the wrist and a wink.
</p>
    
<p>
    >Now, let me be straight with you. The vast majority of
    us have no talent for magic, which means we’re likely to
    look on those who do with some combination of fascination
    and mistrust. We love them because they can do the
    things we’ve only dreamed about, and we hate them for
    the exact same reason. So if you’re Awakened, get used
    to folks eyeing you with interest and suspicion. And be
    ready for anyone with a gun to aim it at you first. It’s the
    Sixth World way.
</p>

<p>
    >One last and very important thing you’ve gotta understand
    about magic: Dragons. They’re large, they’re
    dangerous, and they will mess you up. Ryumyo of Mount
    Fuji fame was the first but definitely not the last dragon
    to have an impact on the Sixth World; they have their
    claws everywhere. The great dragon Ghostwalker reigns over the divided city of Denver. The great feathered
    serpent Hualpa does likewise in Amazonia. A dragon
    named Dunkelzahn managed to get himself elected the
    president of the United Canadian and American States,
    only to get blown up on the night of his inauguration.
    And don’t overlook the corporate dragons—Celedyr directing
    research at NeoNET, Rhonabwy managing a supremely
    massive stock portfolio, and the great dragon
    Lofwyr directing the largest megacorporation on Earth,
    Saeder-Krupp.  Which makes this a good time to talk about the
    megacorporations.
