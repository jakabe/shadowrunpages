>Big Business...

<p>
    >There was a time when the highest law of any land was
    the decrees put down by national governments, and all
    bodies in national borders, individuals and corporations
    alike, were subject to those laws. But there was a time
    even before that when the only law of the world was
    power, and you could do what you wanted as long as you
    had the strength to keep anyone from stopping you (of
    course, history’s full of evidence that this has always been
    the case, even when national governments held sway).
    The state of the Sixth World, then, isn’t really anything
    new. It’s just the latest iteration of the might-makes-right
    way of doing things. The only real change is that once
    upon a time governments were able to restrain corporations,
    or at least enforce some limits. Not any more.
</p>

<p>
    >There’s a lot of legal history we could cover to help
    you see how we got to this point, but in the end it boils
    down to one word: extraterritoriality. That’s the word
    that allows corporations to say that whatever happens
    in their holdings, on the buildings and lands they own,
    is subject to their laws—and no one else’s. Gaining extraterritorial
    status was a long-held dream of many
    of the world’s largest corporations, and when judicial
    decisions in nations across the world gave it to them,
    they spent several years pissing on themselves and
    each other in utter delirium. Then they figured out their
    infighting was cutting into their bottom lines, so they
    stopped fighting one another and concentrated on
    pissing on the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
    >Not every corporation in the world has extraterritorial
    status. To understand who does, you have to know
    about the Corporate Court, the body the megacorporations
    created when they realized they were spending
    too much time solving their disputes by ravaging entire
    small countries. The Corporate Court is sometimes
    mocked as a toothless entity, a puppet of the world’s
    largest megacorps, but it manages—usually—to keep
    open warfare between the corps from breaking out, and
    that’s at least worth something.
</p>

<p>
    >As part of its duties, the Court has created a ranking
    system to tell you how big and powerful a particular corp
    is. At the bottom are the unrated corps, ranging from the
    commlink repair business two guys named Mitch started
    in the back of their Ford Americar to companies that
    stretch from coast to coast of the world’s largest nations
    but don’t cross any borders. To get the lowest ranking
    the corp gives out, the A-ranking, you’ve got to be a
    multinational, doing substantive business in more than
    one country. And no, occasionally selling a bag of WafoCrisps
    to a shepherd in New Zealand doesn’t count.
</p>

<p>
    >The next step, becoming an AA-ranked corporation,
    is the one that gets you the big prize of extraterritoriality.
    To get to this point, you’ve got to show that you’re big in
    several nations, you’re tough, and you can take the drek
    the really big boys may dish out at you when they’re in
    a pissy mood.
</p>

<p>
    >Then you’ve got the top rank, the AAAs. The Big Ten.
    They’re not necessarily the largest megacorporations on
    Earth, but their size, their diversity, and their power set
    them apart. That, and the fact that they somehow convinced
    the other megas to give them a seat on the Corporate
    Court. Because that’s who populates the Court,
    justices from the Big Ten. They are the powers that shape
    the world, and everyone, shadowrunner or not, knows
    their names, because they’re the centers from which nuyen
    flows—and where most of the nuyen normally ends
    up. Ares. Aztechnology. Evo. Horizon. Mitsuhama. Neo-
    NET. Renraku. Saeder-Krupp. Shiawase. Wuxing. If you’re
    going to be a runner for longer than ten minutes, you’re
    going to work for one of these guys, and if you’re going
    to live in the shadows for more than a day, you’re going to get screwed over by them. You need to know about these
    guys, so we’ve got a briefing coming up.
</p>

<p>
    >In the meantime, what you need to understand is that
    these guys are bigger than big. Think of the world’s largest
    manufacturer of computer equipment. Then add in a
    powerful magic supplies broker. Throw in a few banks,
    an insurance firm, an entertainment conglomerate, and
    a snack-food giant, and you’re still not a tenth of the way
    to forming one of the Big Ten. They employ millions of
    people and control trillions of nuyen. They have dozens
    of subsidiaries that, on their own, would be AA- or
    A-rated corporations. Each and every one of them owns
    a piece of land within one hundred kilometers of you, unless
    you’re in the Sahara, the Amazon, or at the bottom of
    the ocean. And maybe even then. And each of them has
    convinced their employees that the safe haven they offer
    is worth decades of low-paying, mundane, soul-sucking
    work. They command the armies of the wageslaves of the
    world, and one way we shadowrunners know who we are
    is that we know we’re not them. Of course, just like them,
    we sell our time and sometimes our lives dancing to the
    megacorporations’ tune. They have the nuyen, and we
    want it, which means they determine what the rules of
    the game are. We just play it.
</p>


<p>
    >But if we’re going to be different than them—stronger,
    faster, and dare I say better—we need an edge. A few of
    us are lucky enough to get that edge through magic.
    For the rest of us, there are augmentations.
