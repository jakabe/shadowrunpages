>out of the corner of your eye...

<p>
>Like I said before, this is a world dominated by the
megacorporations. They like things a certain way, and
that way requires a docile population, a world of people
who do whatever work they’re told, build anything,
carry anything, sacrifice anything for the mega, then
spend all their money in the company store and be glad
they got it so good. Sheep. That’s how megacorps see
metahumanity: a flock of sheep they have to keep in
line to serve their purposes.
</p>

<p>
>Which means the rest of us face a stark choice: Accept
their shit. Or not. There are lots of ways to sell out
in this world and find a corporate master who will order
you around. There’s garbage to be collected, floors to
be swept, numbers to be added. The megas have literal
mountains of menial labor to be performed in a never-
ending series of twelve- or sixteen-hour shifts. Yes,
it’s a lot of work, but you’ll have time off occasionally,
and there’s a whole slew of corporate-approved entertainments.
You can even have relationships with other
people, as long as you don’t associate with anyone your
beloved parent megacorporation might consider in any
way unsuitable. You will never be required to be creative
or inspired. You will never have to take risks. You could
live, potentially, for a long time (if you’re lucky enough
not to contract any diseases on the corporate Do Not
Treat list), and you will have approximately the same
quality of life as a worker bee.
</p>

<p>
>For some of us, that’s not enough. That’s not a life.
The megacorps own enough in the world. They don’t
need to own us. So we drop out, stay away from the life
of a corp drone, and find another way to be. We do the
jobs corps don’t want their regular employees to do, the
things they don’t want connected back to them. Espionage
missions; missions of theft, sabotage, and assault—
maybe assassination if you swing that way. That’s
the kind of work that drifts down into the shadows of
the world, and that’s what we pick up. That’s how we
survive. We still have to dance to the corporate tune to
some degree—who doesn’t?—but we get to live on our
terms, in our way, and if we do it right and build up our
skills, we can become the best at what we do and get
paid what we deserve. Then, maybe, instead of being
one of us, scrambling under the heels of the powerful,
we can be one of them, and remake a small part of the
world in our image.
</p>

<p>
>No matter how each of us got into the shadows,
we’re here now. If we’re going to survive, we have to
find work. There are dozens, hundreds, thousands of
jobs out there. You can make money off of them, but
each one will cost you something. You’ll get a scar from
a bullet that should have killed you. A leg that aches
in the cold because you broke it crashing your motorcycle
on one of your less stylish getaways. A missing
arm because you were standing just a bit too close to a
bomb going off and a working cyber model is pricy. And
that’s just what will happen to your body. You’ll be double-
crossed, betrayed, and abandoned. You’ll see trusted
friends turn on you and watch others die. You’ll have
every last bit of you tested in ways you can’t imagine just
to see how much you can endure.

</p>
>And if you succeed? If you stay alive? Money, first of
all, but more. You become a legend. You join the ranks
of the people we tell stories about, the shadowrunners
whose names we all know. Dirk Montgomery. FastJack.
Sally Tsung. The Smiling Bandit. You’ll have lived your
own life, survived, and even thrived. You’ll have stuck it to
every man the Sixth World has to offer.
As long as you can pay the price.
