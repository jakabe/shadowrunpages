>Central America
<p>
>Central America is one word: Aztlan. And Aztlan is one
word: Aztechnology. The nation is basically a division
of the megacorp. So if you have no problems with Aztechnology,
then you’ve got no problems with Aztlan.
If you’ve managed to piss off the Big A, it’s probably
best to stay off their home ground, as they’ve got eyes
everywhere. The nation stretches from its border with
Texas on the north all the way down to Amazonia in
the south. The Corporate Court controls the Panama
Canal, and the Yucatan is … complicated.
