>There are a number of nations down here, but the
only one with a significant global profile is Amazonia.
Ruled over by the ecologically minded dragon Hualpa,
Amazonia is one place where the corps are secondary
to the nation. Though after the spanking Aztlan
just gave Amazonia in a recent war, the megas might
be looking to flex a little more muscle down there,
because Hualpa might find himself looking for some
new investment.
